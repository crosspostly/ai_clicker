# 📁 Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation and interim reports from the AI-Autoclicker v2.0 development process. These files have been archived to maintain a clean project structure while preserving development history.

## 📋 Archived Files

### Development Progress Reports
- **`ORCHESTRATOR_PROGRESS.md`** - 8-stage release orchestration progress tracking (Nov 2024)
- **`PHASE_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`** - ES6 modules conversion completion report (Nov 2024)
- **`RELEASE_READINESS.md`** - Pre-release readiness assessment (Nov 2024)

### Stage-Based Documentation

- **`STAGE_1_INTEGRATION.md`** - Module integration and primary build documentation
- **`STAGE_2_TESTING.md`** - Testing infrastructure and coverage analysis

## 🏗️ Why These Were Archived

### 1. **Completion Status**
- All documented phases and stages have been completed
- ES6 modules migration is 100% complete
- Rollup bundling is fully implemented
- Testing infrastructure is operational

### 2. **Current Reality vs. Planned Features**
- Many documents refer to "planned" or "future" migrations that are now complete
- References to "partial migration" are outdated - the project is fully modular
- Build system has evolved beyond the documented plans

### 3. **Documentation Consolidation**
- Current state is better reflected in updated core documentation
- Historical progress is preserved here for reference
- Main documentation now focuses on current architecture and usage
